# --- Common AI/ML Libraries (Uncomment and add as needed) ---
# Uncomment any of these lines if your AI agent will use them.
# For example, if you plan to use LangChain, uncomment the 'langchain' line.

# For building LLM applications
# langchain
# pydantic # Often a dependency of langchain, good to include if you use structured outputs


# For deep learning frameworks (choose one or both if needed)
# torch # PyTorch, often with torchvision, torchaudio
# tensorflow # TensorFlow, often with tensorflow-cpu or tensorflow-gpu

# For vector databases/similarity search (choose based on your vector store)
# chromadb
# faiss-cpu
# qdrant-client
# pinecone-client

# For web frameworks (if your agent has a web UI or API)
# fastapi
# uvicorn # ASGI server for FastAPI
# flask
# streamlit
# gradio

# For code formatting (if you enabled it in devcontainer.json)
