## How It Works

### 1. **Resume Template System**
The `ResumeGenerator` class uses a template with placeholders:
```python
template = """# {name}
## {contact_info}
### SUMMARY
{summary}
### WORK EXPERIENCE
{liberty_mutual_bullets}
{inovace_bullets}
...
"""
```

### 2. **Data Injection Process**
- Extracts static data from original resume (dates, locations, contact info)
- Formats optimized bullets from JSON analysis results
- Fills template with both static and dynamic content

### 3. **PDF Creation Pipeline**
- Converts markdown to structured content
- Applies professional styling with ReportLab
- Generates downloadable PDF with proper formatting

## Usage Workflow

2. **Use Keywords for Rewrite** → Generate optimization results
3. **Generate Updated Resume** → Create markdown with template
4. **View Differences** → Compare original vs updated
5. **Create PDF** → Download professional resume
